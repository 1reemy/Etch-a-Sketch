## Overview
This is an Odin Project Assignment, which requires the creation of an etch
a sketch program. The user is able to use this program to create any image 
by moving the mouse over the drawing area. The user is able to choose a different
colors as well as increase the size of the dots to allow for more refinement 
in drawing images.

## Composition of Program
This program was created using HTML, CSS and Javascript.

## Lessons Learnt
- I learnt how to use Event Handler, namely mouseover events to enable the user 
to manipulate the drawing area.
- The most significant feature learnt was how to enable multiple divs to be 
generated within the grid.
- Flexbox was also used to organize the HTML elements on the webpage.
media queries were added to the program for mobile device responsiveness.
